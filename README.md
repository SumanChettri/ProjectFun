# Login Page with Fun Animations

This project is a responsive, interactive login page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features animated elements and a playful mechanism where the login button moves randomly within the container if the username and password are incorrect or left empty. If the correct credentials are entered, the button stops moving, and a success message is displayed.
